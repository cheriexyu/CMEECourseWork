# *My CMEE Coursework Repository*

## General Description
This repository contains my coursework for the Computational Methods of Ecology and Evolution Course (CMEE) at Imperial College. 

All codes in this project was written and tested in R and Python3. Based on the **The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist** [online book](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html).

## Project Structure 
The repository is organised in week structures. Within each week contains the core directories: 
*code*, *data*, *results*, *sandbox*. *code* directories contains coding scripts for the coresponding weeks. *data* directories 
contains data files used for coding. *results* and *sandbox* directories should be empty. When running scripts, output files should 
automatically be moved into *results* directory. 

In brief, the git repository consist of these directories:

    - Week1: Unix/Linux, Bash Shell Scripting and LaTeX

    - Week2: Biological Computing with Python I

    - Week3: Biological Computing with R

    - Week4: Statistics in R 

    - Week5: Spatial Analysis and GIS

    - Week6: Genomics and Bioinformatics

    - Week7: Biological Computing with Python II and Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

    - MiniProject

    - Proposalinside: Project proposal for MRES project 

    - Feedback

    - .gitignore 

Further information on each week content can be found in their indivdual README.md files inside the directories.
