\textbf{Is Florida getting warmer?}





The observed correlation coefficient between years and temperature of Florida was 0.5331784 (Figure\ref{fig:mesh1}).





After random sampling our temperature data by \textit{N=10000} and recalculating the correlation coefficient, our observed correlation coefficient was not within the distribution of our random correlation coefficients (Figure\ref{fig:mesh2}). This suggest that there is a 
significant positive correlation between time and years (p=0). As a result, the current trend suggest that Florida is getting warmer.
