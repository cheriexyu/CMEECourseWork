# *Week 6*


## General Description

Genomics and Bioinformatics  - Population genomics is central to understanding the evolution, ecology and conservation of species. We can use genomic data to see how
species are related and how they evolved and adapted to their environment. The goal of this week is to introduce theories and computational techniques for using population genomic data.

Lectures, exercises and further information of the week can be found on Imperial College life science
