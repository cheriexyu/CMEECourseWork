	abstract = {We argue that population growth rate is the key unifying variable linking the various facets of population ecology. The importance of population growth rate lies partly in its central role in forecasting future population trends; indeed if the form of density dependence were constant and known, then the future population dynamics could to some degree be predicted. We argue that population growth rate is also central to our understanding of environmental stress: environmental stressors should be defined as factors which when first applied to a population reduce population growth rate. The joint action of such stressors determines an organism's ecological niche, which should be defined as the set of environmental conditions where population growth rate is greater than zero (where population growth rate = r = log(e)(N(t+1)/N(t))). While environmental stressors have negative effects on population growth rate, the same is true of population density, the case of negative linear effects corresponding to the well-known logistic equation. Following Sinclair, we recognize population regulation as occurring when population growth rate is negatively density dependent. Surprisingly, given its fundamental importance in population ecology, only 25 studies were discovered in the literature in which population growth rate has been plotted against population density. In 12 of these the effects of density were linear; in all but two of the remainder the relationship was concave viewed from above. Alternative approaches to establishing the determinants of population growth rate are reviewed, paying special attention to the demographic and mechanistic approaches. The effects of population density on population growth rate may act through their effects on food availability and associated effects on somatic growth, fecundity and survival, according to a 'numerical response', the evidence for which is briefly reviewed. Alternatively, there may be effects on population growth rate of population density in addition to those that arise through the partitioning of food between competitors; this is 'interference competition'. The distinction is illustrated using a replicated laboratory experiment on a marine copepod, Tisbe battagliae. Application of these approaches in conservation biology, ecotoxicology and human demography is briefly considered. We conclude that population regulation, density dependence, resource and interference competition, the effects of environmental stress and the form of the ecological niche, are all best defined and analysed in terms of population growth rate.},

	abstract = {To successfully respond to changing habitat, climate or harvest, managers need to identify the most effective strategies to reverse population trends of declining species and/or manage harvest of game species. A classic approach in conservation biology for the last two decades has been the use of matrix population models to determine the most important vital rates affecting population growth rate (λ), that is, sensitivity. Ecologists quickly realized the critical role of environmental variability in vital rates affecting λ by developing approaches such as life-stage simulation analysis (LSA) that account for both sensitivity and variability of a vital rate. These LSA methods used matrix-population modeling and Monte Carlo simulation methods, but faced challenges in integrating data from different sources, disentangling process and sampling variation, and in their flexibility. Here, we developed a Bayesian integrated population model (IPM) for two populations of a large herbivore, elk (Cervus canadensis) in Montana, USA. We then extended the IPM to evaluate sensitivity in a Bayesian framework. We integrated known-fate survival data from radio-marked adults and juveniles, fecundity data, and population counts in a hierarchical population model that explicitly accounted for process and sampling variance. Next, we tested the prevailing paradigm in large herbivore population ecology that juvenile survival of neonates {\textless}90 d old drives λ using our Bayesian LSA approach. In contrast to the prevailing paradigm in large herbivore ecology, we found that adult female survival explained more of the variation in λ than elk calf survival, and that summer and winter elk calf survival periods were nearly equivalent in importance for λ. Our Bayesian IPM improved precision of our vital rate estimates and highlighted discrepancies between count and vital rate data that could refine population monitoring, demonstrating that combining sensitivity analysis with population modeling in a Bayesian framework can provide multiple advantages. Our Bayesian LSA framework will provide a useful approach to addressing conservation challenges across a variety of species and data types.},

This probability is evaluated assuming that the growth of the microbial population can be described by the Gompertz equation with the variance of growth depending on the population size. It is shown that the probability density associated with this phenomenon is skewed, so that the risk of a high microbial population is greater than that which would be estimated using a symmetrical probability distribution such as the Gaussian. Maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the Gompertz equation based on the derived probability density are calculated using data published by Zwietering et al.

The probability that a microbial population of a given size will exceed an unacceptable level within a given time is calculated for growth at two temperatures, 10 and 25°C.

All three models fitted the experimental data well, however, the values of μmax obtained using the Gompertz and logistic models were similar to each other but substantially different from those predicted by the Baranyi–Roberts model. The latter growth model was used to derive a second estimate of μmax based on the slope at the inflection point of the growth curve function; this value was in closer agreement with those obtained using the Gompertz or logistic models. Conditions were identified when values of μmax based on different definitions would converge towards one another.},

	abstract = {Substantive changes in gene expression, metabolism, and the proteome are manifested in overall changes in microbial population growth. Quantifying how microbes grow is therefore fundamental to areas such as genetics, bioengineering, and food safety. Traditional parametric growth curve models capture the population growth behavior through a set of summarizing parameters. However, estimation of these parameters from data is confounded by random effects such as experimental variability, batch effects or differences in experimental material. A systematic statistical method to identify and correct for such confounding effects in population growth data is not currently available. Further, our previous work has demonstrated that parametric models are insufficient to explain and predict microbial response under non-standard growth conditions. Here we develop a hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric model of population growth that identifies the latent growth behavior and response to perturbation, while simultaneously correcting for random effects in the data. This model enables more accurate estimates of the biological effect of interest, while better accounting for the uncertainty due to technical variation. Additionally, modeling hierarchical variation provides estimates of the relative impact of various confounding effects on measured population growth.},

We developed a reproducible experimental system and conducted functional genomic and physiological analyses of a 2-h lag phase in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Adaptation began within 4 min of inoculation into fresh LB medium with the transient expression of genes involved in phosphate uptake. The main lag-phase transcriptional program initiated at 20 min with the upregulation of 945 genes encoding processes such as transcription, translation, iron-sulfur protein assembly, nucleotide metabolism, LPS biosynthesis, and aerobic respiration. ChIP-chip revealed that RNA polymerase was not “poised” upstream of the bacterial genes that are rapidly induced at the beginning of lag phase, suggesting a mechanism that involves de novo partitioning of RNA polymerase to transcribe 522 bacterial genes within 4 min of leaving stationary phase. We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to discover that iron, calcium, and manganese are accumulated by S. Typhimurium during lag phase, while levels of cobalt, nickel, and sodium showed distinct growth-phase-specific patterns. The high concentration of iron during lag phase was associated with transient sensitivity to oxidative stress.

	abstract = {Microbial growth curves are used to study differential effects of media, genetics, and stress on microbial population growth. Consequently, many modeling frameworks exist to capture microbial population growth measurements. However, current models are designed to quantify growth under conditions for which growth has a specific functional form. Extensions to these models are required to quantify the effects of perturbations, which often exhibit nonstandard growth curves. Rather than assume specific functional forms for experimental perturbations, we developed a general and robust model of microbial population growth curves using Gaussian process (GP) regression. GP regression modeling of high-resolution time-series growth data enables accurate quantification of population growth and allows explicit control of effects from other covariates such as genetic background. This framework substantially outperforms commonly used microbial population growth models, particularly when modeling growth data from environmentally stressed populations. We apply the GP growth model and develop statistical tests to quantify the differential effects of environmental perturbations on microbial growth across a large compendium of genotypes in archaea and yeast. This method accurately identifies known transcriptional regulators and implicates novel regulators of growth under standard and stress conditions in the model archaeal organism Halobacterium salinarum For yeast, our method correctly identifies known phenotypes for a diversity of genetic backgrounds under cyclohexamide stress and also detects previously unidentified oxidative stress sensitivity across a subset of strains. Together, these results demonstrate that the GP models are interpretable, recapitulating biological knowledge of growth response while providing new insights into the relevant parameters affecting microbial population growth.},

	abstract = {Most of the models of microbial growth in food are Empirical algebraic, of which the Gompertz model is the most notable, Rate equations, mostly variants of the Verhulst's logistic model, or Population Dynamics models, which can be deterministic and continuous or stochastic and discrete. The models of the first two kinds only address net growth and hence cannot account for cell mortality that can occur at any phase of the growth. Almost invariably, several alternative models of all three types can describe the same set of experimental growth data. This lack of uniqueness is by itself a reason to question any mechanistic interpretation of growth parameters obtained by curve fitting alone. As argued, all the variants of the Verhulst's model, including the Baranyi-Roberts model, are empirical phenomenological models in a rate equation form. None provides any mechanistic insight or has inherent advantage over the others. In principle, models of all three kinds can predict non-isothermal growth patterns from isothermal data. Thus a modeler should choose the simplest and most convenient model for this purpose. There is no reason to assume that the dependence of the “maximum specific growth rate” on temperature, pH, water activity, or other factors follows the original or modified versions of the Arrhenius model, as the success of Ratkowsky's square root model testifies. Most sigmoid isothermal growth curves require three adjustable parameters for their mathematical description and growth curves showing a peak at least four. Although frequently observed, there is no theoretical reason that these growth parameters should always rise and fall in unison in response to changes in external conditions. Thus quantifying the effect of an environmental factor on microbial growth require that all the growth parameters are addressed, not just the “maximum specific growth rate.” Different methods to determine the “lag time” often yield different values, demonstrating that it is a poorly defined growth parameter. The combined effect of several factors, such as temperature and pH or aw, need not be “multiplicative” and therefore ought to be revealed experimentally. This might not be always feasible, but keeping the notion in mind will eliminate theoretical assumptions that are hard to confirm. Modern mathematical software allows to model growing or dying microbial populations where cell division and mortality occur simultaneously and can be used to explain how different growth patterns emerge. But at least in the near future, practical problems, like translating a varying temperature into a corresponding microbial growth curve, will be solved with empirical rate models, which despite not being “mechanistic” are perfectly suitable for this purpose.},

For each set of data a Schoolfield model and a Square Root model were constructed. Predictions from both models were compared with the original data to look at the ‘goodness of fit’. In every case the Schoolfield model was found to be a more reliable description of the experimental data.

It is therefore recommended that the Schoolfield model is used to produce predictive models from bacterial growth data.},

Methods and Results Data obtained at various temperatures and different starting cell densities for Aeromonas hydrophila, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica have been fitted with the Baranyi and Roberts’ model and the new one. On average, the former showed higher standard error and R2 values (0.140 and 0.991) than the Schiraldi's one (0.079 and 0.983). Around 15℃, the increase of temperature showed a milder effect on the growth rate than that expected. Y. enterocolitica showed a practically null duration of the lag phase, no matter the value of the starting density, whereas A. hydrophila and L. monocytogenes revealed slower onset trends. Conclusions Parameter β defines the number of cell duplications and appears independent on temperature, while (β/α)1/2 is proportional to the maximum specific growth rate. The α−1/2 versus temperature trend directly reflects the corresponding behaviour of the growth rate and does not require the use of Arrhenius plots. Significance and Impact of the Study Values of the parameters α and β, as well as the duration of the latency phase, allowed some considerations about the effect of storage temperature in terms of food safety, especially for psychrotrophic bacteria of concern.},

	abstract = {Modeling has become an important tool for widening our understanding of microbial growth in the context of applied microbiology and related to such processes as safe food production, wastewater treatment, bioremediation, or microbe-mediated mining. Various modeling techniques, such as primary, secondary and tertiary mathematical models, phenomenological models, mechanistic or kinetic models, reactive transport models, Bayesian network models, artificial neural networks, as well as agent-, individual-, and particle-based models have been applied to model microbial growth and activity in many applied fields. In this mini-review, we summarize the basic concepts of these models using examples and applications from food safety and wastewater treatment systems. We further review recent developments in other applied fields focusing on models that explicitly include spatial relationships. Using these examples, we point out the conceptual similarities across fields of application and encourage the combined use of different modeling techniques in hybrid models as well as their cross-disciplinary exchange. For instance, pattern-oriented modeling has its origin in ecology but may be employed to parameterize microbial growth models when experimental data are scarce. Models could also be used as virtual laboratories to optimize experimental design analogous to the virtual ecologist approach. Future microbial growth models will likely become more complex to benefit from the rich toolbox that is now available to microbial growth modelers.},

	abstract = {The Gompertz model is well known and widely used in many aspects of biology. It has been frequently used to describe the growth of animals and plants, as well as the number or volume of bacteria and cancer cells. Numerous parametrisations and re-parametrisations of varying usefulness are found in the literature, whereof the Gompertz-Laird is one of the more commonly used. Here, we review, present, and discuss the many re-parametrisations and some parameterisations of the Gompertz model, which we divide into Ti (type I)- and W0 (type II)-forms. In the W0-form a starting-point parameter, meaning birth or hatching value (W0), replaces the inflection-time parameter (Ti). We also propose new “unified” versions (U-versions) of both the traditional Ti -form and a simplified W0-form. In these, the growth-rate constant represents the relative growth rate instead of merely an unspecified growth coefficient. We also present U-versions where the growth-rate parameters return absolute growth rate (instead of relative). The new U-Gompertz models are special cases of the Unified-Richards (U-Richards) model and thus belong to the Richards family of U-models. As U-models, they have a set of parameters, which are comparable across models in the family, without conversion equations. The improvements are simple, and may seem trivial, but are of great importance to those who study organismal growth, as the two new U-Gompertz forms give easy and fast access to all shape parameters needed for describing most types of growth following the shape of the Gompertz model.},

Population density at carrying capacity plays an important role in evolutionary processes, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, yet how it varies with temperature-dependent metabolism remains unclear. Though the exponential effect of temperature on intrinsic population growth rate, r, is well known, we still lack clear evidence that population density at carrying capacity, K, declines with increasing per capita metabolic rate, as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). We experimentally tested whether temperature effects on photosynthesis propagate directly to population carrying capacity in a model species, the mobile phytoplankton Tetraselmis tetrahele. After maintaining populations at a fixed resource supply and fixed temperatures for 43 days, we found that carrying capacity declined with increasing temperature. This decline was predicted quantitatively when models included temperature-dependent metabolic rates and temperature-associated body-size shifts. Our results demonstrate that warming reduces carrying capacity and that temperature effects on body size and metabolic rate interact to determine how temperature affects population dynamics. These findings bolster efforts to relate metabolic temperature dependence to population and ecosystem patterns via MTE.},

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), particularly Lactobacillus plantarum, Weissella viridescens and Lactobacillus sakei, are the main spoilage bacteria of refrigerated, vacuum-packed meat products, stored in modified atmosphere, and their growth determines the shelf life length of these products. The objective of this study was to model the growth of L. plantarum, W. viridescens and L. sakei under different isothermal cultivation conditions and establish secondary models to describe the effect of temperature on the growth parameters of these bacteria. The LAB growth was evaluated in culture medium at temperatures of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 30 ºC. The fit of Baranyi and Roberts (BAR) and Gompertz (GO) primary models to the growth curves of LAB was compared by statistical indices, in which the BAR model showed slightly better fits to the experimental data. The BAR growth parameters were used to establish the secondary models, µmax and Nmax were established for the three LAB. The power model described the influence of temperature on the parameter λ for L. plantarum, and other bacteria showed no lag phase. The growth of LAB was strongly influenced by storage temperature and the obtained models allow predicting the growth of these bacteria within the temperature range from 4 to 30 ºC.},

Two of the three toxic cultures studied produced more toxins in axenic than in nonaxenic cultures. High toxin production correlated with high nitrogen concentrations (test range, 0.42 to 84 mg of N per liter) and low light intensity (test range, 12 to 95 microeinsteins/m2 per s). Toxin production depended on phosphorus concentration at low levels of phosphorus (0.1 to 0.4 mg of P per liter) and higher concentrations had no additional effect. The optimum temperature for toxin production and growth of green O. agardhii was 25 degrees C. Red O. agardhii produced almost similar amounts of toxin at temperatures of 15 to 25 degrees C. The lowest toxin production by both strains was at 30 degrees C.},

	abstract = {The temperature of chilled foods is an important variable for the shelf life of a product in a production and distribution chain. To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the growth as a function of temperature. The temperature is often not constant in various stages of distribution. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of shifts in temperature. The suitability and usefulness of several models to describe the growth of Lactobacillus plantarum with fluctuating temperatures was evaluated. It can be assumed that temperature shifts within the lag phase can be handled by adding relative parts of the lag time to be completed and that temperature shifts within the exponential phase result in no lag phase. With these assumptions, the kinetic behavior of temperature shift experiments was reasonably well predicted, and this hypothesis was accepted statistically in 73\% of the cases. Only shifts of temperature around the minimum temperature for growth showed very large deviations from the model prediction. The best results were obtained with the assumption that a temperature shift (within the lag phase as well as within the exponential phase) results in an additional lag phase. This hypothesis was accepted statistically in 93\% of the cases. The length of the additional lag phase is one-fourth of the lag time normally found at the temperature after the shift.},

AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a “savvy” prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used.

Such models are {\textless}2 ∆AIC units because the penalty for one additional parameter is -2 AIC units, but model deviance is not reduced by an amount sufficient to overcome the 2-unit penalty and, hence, the additional parameter provides no net reduction in AIC. Simply put, the uninformative parameter does not explain enough variation to justify its inclusion in the model and it should not be interpreted as having any ecological effect. Models with uninformative parameters are frequently presented as being competitive in the Journal of Wildlife Management, including 72\% of all AIC-based papers in 2008, and authors and readers need to be more aware of this problem and take appropriate steps to eliminate misinterpretation. I reviewed 5 potential solutions to this problem: 1) report all models but ignore or dismiss those with uninformative parameters, 2) use model averaging to ameliorate the effect of uninformative parameters, 3) use 95\% confidence intervals to identify uninformative parameters, 4) perform all-possible subsets regression and use weight-of-evidence approaches to discriminate useful from uninformative parameters, or 5) adopt a methodological approach that allows models containing uninformative parameters to be culled from reported model sets.

The idea that the focal mechanisms of foreshocks may differ from that of background activity was advocated by Y. Chen and identified by M. Ohtake as possibly the thus far most neglected property of foreshocks, in efforts to identify them. S. Matsumura proposed that focal mechanism patterns of small earthquakes may differ character istically near locked fault segments into which fault creep is advancing. Considerable discussion was devoted to the status of the seismic gap hypothesis because M. Wyss argued that the occurrence of the M 7. 9, 1986, Andreanof Islands earthquake was a confirmation of Reid's rebound theory of earthquakes and thus of the time predictable version of the gap hypothesis, whereas Y.

The two most widely used primary growth models are the Baranyi and Gompertz models. A three-phase linear model was developed to determine how well growth curves could be described using a simpler model. The model divides bacterial growth curves into three phases: the lag and stationary phases where the specific growth rate is zero (gm=0), and the exponential phase where the logarithm of the bacterial population increases linearly with time (gm=constant). The model has four parameters: No(Log8of initial population density), NMAX(Log8of final population density), tLAG(time when lag phase ends), and tMAX(time when exponential phase ends). A comparison of the linear model was made against the Baranyi and Gompertz models, using established growth data forEscherichia coli0157:H7. The growth curves predicted by the three models showed good agreement. The linear model was more ‘robust' than the others, especially when experimental data were minimal. The physiological assumptions underlying the linear model are discussed, with particular emphasis on assuring that the model is consistent with bacterial behavior both as individual cells and as populations. It is proposed that the transitional behavior of bacteria at the end of the lag phase can be explained on the basis of biological variability.},

Objective: To formulate a mathematical model that describes the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in batch fermentation. Methodology: Based on real-life experimental data from eight LAB strains, we formulated a primary model in the form of a third-degree polynomial function that successfully describes the four phases observed in LAB growth, i.e., lag, exponential, stationary, and death. Our cubic mathematical model allows us to understand the fundamental nonlinear dynamics of LAB as well as its time-variant dependencies. Parameters of the model are written in terms of initial biomass, maximum biomass, maximum growth rate, and lag phase duration. Further, a statistical analysis was performed to compare our cubic primary model with the ones proposed by Gompertz, Baranyi, and Vázquez-Murado by computing the coefficient of determination R2, the residual sum of squares RSS, and the Akaike Information Criterion AIC. Results: The average statistical results from the cubic model are as follows: R2=0.820 providing a better fit than the other three models, RSS=0.658 and AIC=−6.499, where both values are lower than the other models considered in this study. Conclusion: The cubic primary model formulated in this work describes the behavior of biomass as it accurately represents the four phases of biomass growth in batch fermentation process.},

The main aim of this work was to generate a predictive model in milk acidified with lactic acid to mimic conditions found in a range of dairy products. A complete factorial design was employed to determine the effects of pH (4·5-7·5), temperature (3·35°C) and salt concentration (0-8\%) on growth of the organism. There were 210 design points and growth curves were individually fitted for the Gompertz function using non-linear regression. Descriptors of the curves, such as lag phase duration (LPD), exponential growth rate (EGR) and generation time (GT) were calculated and polynomial models were developed relating these to pH, temperature and salt concentration. The selected cubic polynomial model gave acceptable predictive estimates of growth and was stable, i.e. predictions were repeatable over the range of environmental variables studied. The model was further tested to determine its capacity for predicting growth of listeria in a range of dairy foods and these validation studies confirm its usefulness as a rapid means for estimating growth of the organism under specified environmental conditions.},

The model was validated using data from published literature and was found to give realistic predictions for doubling times in foods, including meat and meat products, milk, dairy products and vegetables. Predictions from this model (Baranyi and Roberts, 1994) compared favourably with those from the models of Buchanan and Phillips (1990), Murphy et al. (1996) and the Food MicroModel.},

	abstract = {The effect of temperature on the growth of psychrotrophs in dairy products has been studied using the ‘square root’ and Arrhenius models. The square root model has been shown to accurately predict temperature effects on the growth of several psychrotrophs in a number of dairy products. The formula can be applied for individual bacteria regardless of growth medium. This was not true for the Arrhenius equation. In this case, the apparent activation energy for growth (μ) was dependent on source of isolate and growth medium. For isolates from pasteurized cream, μ values were lower during growth in double cream than those obtained during growth in full-fat milk. This was due to shorter generation times at lower temperatures when these isolates were grown in double cream. Temperature-growth parameters were similar for bacteria grown in pasteurized as well as UHT products.},
