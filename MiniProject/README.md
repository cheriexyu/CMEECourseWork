# *MiniProject*


## General Description

The MiniProject aims to address the question: What mathematical models best fit an empirical dataset? The project I have choosen is based on applying phenomenolgical and mechanisitc mathematical models on to functional response data in bacterial species. This directory contains all codes, datas and the final output report within my investigation.

## Languages
Python 3.9, R 4.1.2, Bash

***
## Dependencies
IDEs such as RStudio and Visual Studio Code 

***
## Installation
Here is a list of packages installed within each language during the coding process: 

Package Installations for use in Python 3.9 

[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) package allows for data creation, manipulation and undergoing basic arithemtic calculations within Python. 
Can use `pip` to install packages on bash terminal.  

```bash
pip3 install numpy
```
Note: `pip3` download packages directly into Python version 3.9

[Panda](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) package was widely used in my data wrangling and plotting phase. Panda is beneficial for creating and manipulating dataframes.

```bash
pip3 install pandas
```

[SciPy](https://scipy.org/) package is simillar to Numpy however it is recommended for more complex numerical operations. In the miniproject, the subpackages `scipy.stats`, `linregress` was mainly used. [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) allows you to undergo statistical analysis within Python (e.g correlation, probability distributions...). In my case, I used the [scipy.stats.linregress](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html) function to calculate least square regression. 

```python
import scipy as sc
from scipy import stats 
from scipy.stats import linregress
```

[lmfit()](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/) In the main part of my project, I utilized the `lmfit` function for non-Linear least-squares minimization and curve-Fitting in Python. One of the key concepts in `lmfit` is the `Parameter` object. The parameter can be varied in a fit, you can add parameters into an equation or get minimzed parameters after model fitting. More information to this can be found [here](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/parameters.html#lmfit.parameter.Parameter). I applied this object to create starting values and used them for plotting my mathematical curves. The `minimize()` function was widely used during model fitting. The `minimize` function takes an objective function and it's parameters and minimize the fitting. I used the default leastsq Levenberg-Marquardt method. More information can be found [here](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/fitting.html#the-minimize-function). After minimization, to generate fitted results, use the function [`report_fit`](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/fitting.html#getting-and-printing-fit-reports). 

```bash
pip3 install lmfit
```
```python
from lmfit import Minimizer, Parameters, report_fit
```

[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library is used to create visualizations in Python. In my miniproject, I used `matplotlib` to generate plots. 
```bash
pip3 install matplotlib
```
Importing `matplotlib` to be used within the module `Pylab` (already embedded inside `matplotlib`) in Python:
```python
import matplotlib.pylab as pl
```   

Package Installations for use in R 4.1:

[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package in R includes the core packages ( tidyr, ggplot2, dplyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats). I used `ggplot` and `dplyr` to create plots in R, and `dplyr` to edit, filter and create dataframes. 

```bash
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```r
library(dplyr)
```

In my report writing, I incoportaed an example plot of the sigmoid curve generated from R. To utilize a non-linear least square regression, the package `minpack.lm` was installed. The package is ran with the code `nlsLM()` using a modification of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. More information is provided [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/minpack.lm/index.html)

```r
install.packages("minpack.lm")
```
To run non-linear least square regressions: 
```r
nlsLM()
```
